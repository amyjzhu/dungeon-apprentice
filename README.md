All the thanks in the world to r/droiddruid for the json

Idea: make it easier to generate D&D encounters based on party level, difficulty, monster CR, environment
## Todo 
- Implement algorithm
- Properly deserialize JSON
- Spin up database for storing monster data (docker with windows?)
- uhhh...
- user interface with Angular2
