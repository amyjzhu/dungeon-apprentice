All the thanks in the world to r/droiddruid for the json

Idea: make it easier to generate D&D encounters based on party level, difficulty, monster CR, environment
## Todo 
- :seedling: Implement algorithm
- :seedling: Properly deserialize JSON (see attached script)
- :blossom: Spin up database for storing monster data (docker with windows?)
- :chestnut: uhhh...
- :chestnut: user interface with Angular2
- :seedling: generate insert script for constants
- :seedling: mockdatabase for now and test matchup
